# HAND_WRITTEN_DIGIT_RECOGNIZATION WITH NEURAL NETWORKS

Welcome to my Handwritten Digit Recognition project repository! In this project, I've developed a robust digit recognition system using neural networks, leveraging the power of Python libraries such as NumPy, TensorFlow, Keras, and Matplotlib.

# Project Overview
Handwritten digit recognition is a fundamental problem in the field of computer vision and machine learning. With the rise of deep learning, neural networks have become a popular choice for solving this task. In this project, I've implemented a neural network model capable of accurately recognizing handwritten digits ranging from 0 to 9.

# Key Features
Neural Network Architecture: The model architecture consists of multiple layers, including convolutional and dense layers, designed to effectively learn and extract features from handwritten digit images.

# Training and Testing
The model was trained on a dataset called mnist for handwritten digit images, and its performance was evaluated using separate testing data. Achieved high accuracy and robustness in digit recognition.
 
# Custom Image Testing 
Implemented functionality to test the model on custom handwritten digit images, enabling users to assess its performance in real-world scenarios.
